Write code structured into well-defined functions with clear documentation. Each function s**hould adhere to the following format:**

```python
def function_name(arg1, arg2):
    """
    Brief description of the function's purpose and behavior.

    Args:
        arg1 (type): Description of the first argument, including assumptions, required type (e.g., int, float, str, np.float32, etc.), and details of each dimension (if applicable).
        arg2 (type): Description of the second argument, including assumptions, required type, and details of each dimension (if applicable).

    Returns:
        type: Description of the return value, including assumptions, type, and details of each dimension (if applicable).

    Raises:
        ValueError: Description of the conditions under which this exception is raised (e.g., if `arg2` is negative).
    """
    # Implementation of the function
```

Key Requirements:

1. **Align Code with Project README**: Ensure all functions and modules align with the specifications and goals outlined in the project's README file.

2. **Follow `requirements.txt` Libraries**: Use only the libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file. If additional libraries could improve functionality, suggest them explicitly and explain their benefits.

3. **Dimension Documentation**: Include detailed information about dimensions and their meanings in the docstrings. For example:

   - If a parameter is a matrix, specify its shape (e.g., `arg1 (np.ndarray): A matrix of shape (m, n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns`).
   - If specific dimensional constraints are required for the function to operate correctly, include these in the `Args` section.

4. **Data Types**: Clearly state the required data type for each argument and the return value. For instance, specify whether an argument must be an integer, a floating-point number, or a specific NumPy dtype (e.g., `np.float32`, `np.float64`).

5. The purpose of this code is educational, every task should be broken down into small functions, each of which does something new and different.



The 'interface` file is an interactive Python file. If you write in it, you don't need to divide things into functions, but into cells divided by `# %%`
