Write code divided into clear functions with brief documentation that includes:
Input parameters and assumptions
Function purpose/behavior
Return value/output
in this format:
```
def f(arg1, arg2):
    """
    Main purpose of function demonstration.
    
    Args:
        arg1 (type): First argument description and assumptions and and dimension what is every dimension (if has)
        arg2 (type): Second argument description and assumptions and dimension what is every dimension (if has)
        
    Returns:
        type: Description of what the function returns, asuumptions, and what is every dim (if has)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If arg2 is negative
    """
```


Project should align with README specifications.
Add necessary elements but keep documentation concise.
Use libraries specified in requirements.txt. Suggest additional packages if needed.
remember to add Add dimension and what every dimension represents to the docstrings.
think if the functoin need certain dimension to work properly, add it to the docstring. or it need certain type of dtype like int, float, str, or np.float32, np.float64, etc. add it to the docstring.
